# Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Classification using a neural network 
## The dataset Activity was built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing basic activities and postural transitions while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. They performed a protocol of activities composed of six basic activities: three static postures (standing, sitting, lying) and three dynamic activities (walking, walking downstairs and walking upstairs). The experiment also included postural transitions that occurred between the static postures. These are: stand-to-sit, sit-to-stand, sit-to-lie, lie-to-sit, stand-to-lie, and lie-to-stand. 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz were captured using the embedded accelerometer and gyroscope of the device.
